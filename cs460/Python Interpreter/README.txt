For this phase of the project I only got the arrays to be read in and their indicies to be evaluted so unforunately nothing else works for this phase.

Everuthing from the last phases should work except this same error from last time:

	The sim statement is not liking having no end of line after it, therefore the if and for indentented statemnts will only work if followed by a dedented simple statement.
	For some reason I get a null character when this happens^^


	The simplestatement doesnt work with EOF, however this is how the grammar rules are laid out.
	Think I fixed this.
